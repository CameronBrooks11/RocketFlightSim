flight/sim main differences in first 4/5 seconds - about 1000 ft off around motor burnout

probably not: add an option to sim Prometheus data from motor burnout without airbrakes deployment? -> just set deployment angle to 0 for the whole flight

something so that the sim data goes down towards the experimental data (~ rotation CW)

other people are also having ork underestimate drag:

THE HORIZONTAL VELOCITY IS GOING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE AIRBRAKES GIVING A BIGGER THAN EXPECTED APOGEE CHANGE!!!

for the experimental datasets, the velocity not being 0/the acceleration not being -g at apogee could help with finding out the horizontal motion

rocketpy ← branch with air brakes: https://github.com/RocketPy-Team/RocketPy/tree/enh/air-brakes

determine how far from the launchpad it lands. for fun: animation of flight
add wind effects
    can do the CFD a few times to get how drag profile changes with different expected wind conditions

use sim on controller?? ask Cam exactly what's needed at waypoints

what rough magnitude of change does weathercocking have (fn of stability in tube calibers?)
