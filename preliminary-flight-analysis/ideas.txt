flight/sim main differences in first 4/5 seconds - about 1000 ft off around motor burnout

probably not: add an option to sim Prometheus data from motor burnout without airbrakes deployment?

something so that the sim data goes down towards the experimental data (~ rotation CW)

comparisons to ORK sims

maybe make it so that I can run one function to sim an ascent and save it to a variable (flight class?)

THE HORIZONTAL VELOCITY IS GOING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE AIRBRAKES GIVING A BIGGER THAN EXPECTED APOGEE CHANGE!!!

for the experimental datasets, the velocity not being 0/the acceleration not being -g at apogee could help with finding out the horizontal motion

add wind effects, determine how far from the launchpad it lands. for fun: animation of flight?
